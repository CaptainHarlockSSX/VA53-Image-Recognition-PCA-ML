# Benchmarking PCA and Machine Learning algorithms for face detection purpose

University project aiming to compare PCA and Machine Learning methods to process face recognition on a small set of images.

To use the programs :

- **Define your images paths in all the files**, in the function `loadImageDatabase`

- Edit `pca.py` line 128 to set the number of PCA compenents you want, then run the program with Python

- Edit `modelTraining.py` line 95 to set the number of iterations you want for the ML model, then line 98 to choose where to store the model. Run the code with Python

- Edit `faceRecognition.py` line 63 to set the path of a stored model. Run the code with Python.
